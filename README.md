had a trip down memory lane to my youth of bbs days and loading ansi graphics on ACiD and iCE inspired bbses from the 90s after trying to realize how this guy is raking in a fortune for 50k to 100k for such horrible ansi graphics design??

```
docker run -it -d -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix c4pt/oldstyle-acid-ansi-pack-june-1995
cd /acid-graphics
dosbox FREEVIEW.EXE
dir /p
FREEVIEW.EXE 69-SUCCO.RIP

FREEVIEW.EXE (select a .RIP drawing)

HOW IS THIS GUY SELLING ANSI ARTWORK SO HORRIBLE FOR 100K USD ? https://opensea.io/assets/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/6166
